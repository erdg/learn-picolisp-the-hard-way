# Exercise 1: Welcome to the REPL

At your command line, type
```bash
$ pil +
:
```
A happy little colon should be looking at you, awaiting any questions you might have about PicoLisp.

But first things first. What the heck is a 'REPL', anyway? It stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop. That's a fancy way of saying that PicoLisp is going to look at what you type, do something with it, show you the result, and then wait for you to type something else.

So let's get typing!
```lisp
: 15
-> 15
: 16
-> 16
: 23457890
-> 23457890
```
Numbers!
